In this app discussions are divided into categories that contain threads. These threads contain messages that users and admins can search by keyword.  

Users can 
-  create an account
-  send messages, modify and delete them
-  create new threads. When creating a new thread, the user can choose whether the thread is public or private. If the user chooses the private option, they can then select specific usernames, who will be able to see the thread besides admins. 

Admins can
